<b>Doomsday stage, computational challenge of applied sciences.</b><br><br>
Simulation made in MatLab about a collision between an asteroid and the Earth through applied mathematics. This project presents the results and conclusions of the initial problem of the challenge of the avenue of applied sciences, which consists of the possible collision between the Earth and a small comet that has the same orbital plane as it, through: the calculation, the properties and applications of the ellipse as a conic section.
